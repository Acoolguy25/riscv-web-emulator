    <h2>RISC-V Architecture Overview</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        RISC-V
      </a> is an open-standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on the principles of Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC).  
      Designed to be simple, modular, and extensible, it enables efficient hardware implementations ranging from small embedded microcontrollers to high-performance processors.

    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Open and free:</strong> RISC-V is royalty-free and open source, encouraging wide adoption and innovation.</li>
      <li><strong>Modular ISA:</strong> Core ISA with optional extensions (e.g., integer multiplication, floating-point, atomic operations).</li>
      <li><strong>Scalable:</strong> Supports 32-bit, 64-bit, and 128-bit address spaces.</li>
      <li><strong>Simple encoding:</strong> Fixed-length 32-bit instructions with compact encoding for efficiency.</li>
      <li><strong>Designed for extensibility:</strong> Users can add custom instructions without conflicting with the base ISA.</li>
    </ul>
