    <h2>RISC-V Emulator Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This emulator is a WebAssembly-based RISC-V RV64 platform that I developed to run a monolithic kernel and user applications directly in a modern browser.  
      It builds upon the <a href="https://github.com/tommythorn/simmerv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simmerv project by Tommy Thorn</a>, which itself is a fork of 
      <a href="https://github.com/takahirox/riscv-rust" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Takahiro’s riscv-rust repository</a>.

    <h3>Key Enhancements and Features I Added</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Multiple UART screens:</strong> I expanded support to three UART terminals, enabling simultaneous multi-screen output instead of just one.</li>
      <li><strong>Kernel printing support:</strong> I added direct kernel log output visible in the browser’s developer console for easier debugging.</li>
      <li><strong>Real-Time Clock (RTC):</strong> I integrated an RTC device emulation to provide current time to applications.</li>
      <li><strong>Small patches:</strong> I applied various bug fixes and incremental improvements to enhance stability and usability.</li>
      <li><strong>Legacy compatibility:</strong> Throughout, I maintained core design and performance optimizations inherited from the original projects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Technical Highlights</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Runs fully inside the browser using WebAssembly, delivering near-native performance.</li>
      <li>Implements multiple MMIO devices like UART, CLINT, PLIC, VirtIO block device, RNG, and RTC.</li>
      <li>Supports Sv39 virtual memory with full paging and protection for kernel and user processes.</li>
      <li>Designed for smooth integration with the Rust-based kernel and user programs I developed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>About Sharing My Kernel Code</h3>
    <p>
      Due to the ECE 391 course policy that prohibits publicly posting kernel source code to avoid academic dishonesty, I’m not able to share my full kernel source here.  
      However, I’m happy to discuss architecture, design decisions, and emulator features while respecting these guidelines.
